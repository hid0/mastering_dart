## Number
* Number is a numeric data type, there are two types of Number data types, int and double
* int is an integer data type
* double is a decimal number data type
* The comma in double is written using a period, not a comma, so if we want to make a decimal number 0,5 (zero point five)[in Bahasa], then we write 0.5

## ```int```
#### example code
```dart
int number1 = 10;
double number2 = 11.3;

print(number1);
print(number2);
```
